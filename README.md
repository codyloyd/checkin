# Checkin App

Remote-friendly scrum checkins without the annoying meetings.

An educational student app project originally designed for Learn JavaScript with Eric Elliott.

Users can sign in with GitHub, create and Join SCRUM teams and then do daily "checkins" where they answer the following SCRUM stand-up meeting questions:
- What did you do on the last workday?
- What are you doing today?
- Is there anything blocking you?
